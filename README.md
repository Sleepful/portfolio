This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

This project uses [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), I set up TailwindCSS with the help of [this blog post](https://medium.com/better-programming/how-to-set-up-next-js-with-tailwind-css-b93ccd2d4164). But it's probably easier to just start by cloning the TailwindCSS example of [this repo](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-tailwindcss).
